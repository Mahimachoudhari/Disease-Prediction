Patient Clustering and Risk Prediction

🩺 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing patient data**, identifying clusters of patients with similar characteristics, and predicting the risk of disease. By combining **unsupervised learning** (clustering) and **supervised learning** (classification), healthcare professionals can better understand patient patterns and make informed decisions.

The system helps to:

* Segment patients into meaningful clusters.
* Predict the likelihood of disease for a new patient.
* Visualize patterns in patient demographics and medical features.

⚡Features

* **Patient Clustering:** Groups patients based on similarities in medical features using clustering algorithms.
* **Disease Risk Prediction:** Predicts if a patient is at risk of a disease using machine learning models.
* **Data Visualization:** Includes scatter plots, distribution plots, and heatmaps to understand patient data patterns.
* **User Input Prediction:** Allows testing disease prediction for new patient data.

 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Data Handling & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Random Forest, StandardScaler, KMeans)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Development Environment:** Google colab

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains patient records with features such as:

* Age
* Weight
* Blood Pressure (Systolic & Diastolic)
* Cholesterol Level
* Heart Rate
* Smoking / Alcohol Habits
* Gender
* Other relevant medical indicators
* 
💻Input/Output

**Input:**
A new patient’s medical information as a list of values:

python
new_patient = [[45, 70, 140, 90, 160, 85, 1, 1, 0, 1]]  # Example

**Output:**
Prediction of disease risk:

Disease Prediction: YES

**Clustering Output:**

* Cluster IDs for each patient
* Cluster visualization showing patient distribution

🔍Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features using `StandardScaler`.
2. **Clustering:**

   * Apply KMeans to segment patients into distinct clusters based on medical characteristics.
3. **Classification:**

   * Train a Random Forest classifier to predict disease risk.
4. **Model Evaluation:**

   * Evaluate model accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. **Prediction:**

   * Input new patient data to predict risk.


📈Visualizations

* **Pair Plots:** Explore relationships between features.
* **Distribution Plots:** Examine distribution of age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
* **Heatmaps:** Identify correlations between features.
* **Cluster Scatter Plots:** Show patient grouping after clustering.

🔎Inference

* Patients in cluster `0` may have higher risk factors like elevated blood pressure or cholesterol.
* Random Forest model accurately predicts disease risk for new patients based on historical patterns.
* Visualizations help in understanding patient demographics and medical risk factors efficiently.
